## The Origin

The "Hot Dog Stand" theme first appeared in Windows 3.1 and demonstrated that the interface could adapt to any color scheme... even a terrible one. And they succeeded.

## What is this? Or rather... WHY?

This theme for Godot was born from a self-imposed challenge: to create a Godot theme, modifying the interface as much as possible, live on Twitch.

But really... it's a tribute.

A tribute to those brave souls who dare to go beyond the established norms simply "because I can."

A tribute to those who appreciate coherent ugliness, proving that if you find an interface ugly... you're probably uglier. There's no such thing as an ugly interface if it's coherent and useful.

## Do you expect anyone to use it in a non-ironic way?

Everything has its place and purpose... it just needs someone to find it.

Our intention is that this theme can completely replace the Godot interface, allowing you to create your own games with it. Perhaps not full games, but certainly those sections that simulate a retro PC from the early 90s.

Once the whole theme is done, we'll create a color "customizer" so it's easy to change without affecting the entire theme.

## Do you expect it to be included as a theme within Godot?

We'd love to be like Passivestar... but we doubt it will be included, not even as an Easter Egg: a theme takes up more resources than it seems, and considering that Godot is less than 160MB... every megabyte counts.
